## Stonks only go up!

Currently a day trader who is looking to turn his $ to $$$$$$. ðŸ“°ðŸ™Œ



## Vroom vroom

Love cars and motorsport, and my favorite car since I was 12 was the GT86 (guess what car I have right now).

Also raced in an online racing tournament with a driving simulator using [Radical RXCs](https://www.radicalsportscars.com/our-cars/rxc-gt-road), and hope to be able to drive these crazy cars in real life!


## Music

Favorite genre of music is gangster rap / R&B / Lo-Fi. Want to get a turntable so I can start DJ'ing and mixing records. Also want to try my hand at creating raps and flows when I have more time.

Also have a karaoke machine at home that we rap to haha
